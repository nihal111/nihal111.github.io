I am currently a student at Georgia Tech pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science. I completed my undergraduate studies from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.
  
Coding has been a serious hobby since long. I have enjoyed programming ever since I knew what it meant. I continue to learn, develop and build new things every day.  

I'm interested in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning as applied to speech and text processing. I have worked with [Prof. Diyi Yang][dyang] on the topic of Disfluency Detection and with [Prof. Preethi Jyothi][pjyothi] at [CSALT][csalt] on the task of synthetic generation and language modeling of code-switched Hindi-English text.
  
I actively participate in hackathons. In my freshman year, along with two of my friends, Akash and Arpan, I formed the Ferozepurwale hackathon team. Together we have won several prizes (full list [here][hackathons]).

I am an Open Source enthusiast and I strongly believe in the FOSS philosophy. I'm a contributor and organization member at [MovingBlocks- Terasology]. I also completed my Google Summer of Code (GSoC) with Terasology in the summer of 2017. I have been a mentor with MovingBlocks for Google Code-In (high school level GSoC) since our first GCI participation in 2016. In 2018, I was one of the GSoC mentors and was chosen to represent MovingBlocks at the GSoC mentor summit at Google HQ, Sunnyvale, CA.

The Web and Coding Club is like my family at IIT Bombay. In my junior year at IIT Bombay (2017-18), I managed the club, leading a team of 22 sophomores to carry out activities which help people learn and build an interest in programming.
  
I like to listen to rock music, specifically progressive rock, post-rock, classic and heavy metal. I enjoy watching science fiction and thrillers. I'm a football fan. Even though it's been a while since I stopped following the premier league, I play whenever I get the chance. I used to be an avid gamer but I play only occasionally now-- huge Assassins Creed and Call of Duty fan.  
  
Over the past few years, I have learnt a lot. I have successfully 'completed' and contributed to a few [projects].  

For a detailed list of my projects and achievements, check out my [CV][CV].  

I write infrequently, check out my [blog].
