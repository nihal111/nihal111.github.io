            });
        });

    });
}); 

&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The start to GSoC has been smooth. Currently as I write this wrap up post for week one and two, my work has already crossed the week 3 mark according to my proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-have-i-been-up-to&quot;&gt;What have I been up to?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been adding new features to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Terasology/WildAnimals&quot;&gt;WildAnimals&lt;/a&gt; module. The module only had a deer that idly moved around and did nothing else. When hit it would lose health and ultimately just disappear as a glitch when it’s health reached 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot has happened since and at this point there are 4 variants of the deer that exhibit very different behaviors- &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;deer&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;insensitiveDeer&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;aggressiveDeer&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hostileDeer&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we get into details of how these were built, let’s have a look at a few preview videos:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videowrapper&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/unAqMHKkSC0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;videowrapper&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SjuMzl-5qIc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;importing-an-animal-in-game&quot;&gt;Importing an animal in game&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First an animal model is made in blender. After an artist finishes up a model, gets it rigged, UV Mapped and adds animations, it is pushed to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MetaTerasology/WildAnimals/&quot;&gt;Meta repository&lt;/a&gt; that holds all the blender files for creature models. There is a comprehensive guide on how to add creatures in game &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Terasology/TutorialAssetSystem/wiki/Add-a-creature&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; that I’ve written. Also there is one written by flo, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MovingBlocks/TeraMisc/blob/master/blender_addons/io_md5_exporter/tutorial/Tutorial.md&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/quaternius&quot;&gt;quaternius&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve been getting some help with animal models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;working-with-the-animal-in-game&quot;&gt;Working with the animal in game&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each animal has a prefab file located &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Terasology/WildAnimals/tree/master/assets/prefabs/animals&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; that details the characterstics of the animal as components. To know more about components and the Entity system architecture, go &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki/Entity-System-Architecture&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
Once an animal prefab is made, it can be spawned in game by typing &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;spawnPrefab prefabName&lt;/code&gt; in the console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;event-driven-behavior-system&quot;&gt;Event driven Behavior System&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four different deer I mentioned really have the same animal model, animations and texture. They only vary in behavior. This behavior handling forms the crux of the WildAnimals module. Let’s dive into a little more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Behavior System built in the engine allows something known as behavior trees, to define a certain behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;collapsiblecontainer&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;collapsibleheader&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;+ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is a behavior tree?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;collapsiblecontent&quot;&gt;   
	A behavior tree is used to define conditional or sequential behavior for an entity. A behavior tree essentially has a set of nodes, each node executes some logic and has a condition set for when it would return a status of FAILURE, SUCCESS or simply keep RUNNING. An involved behavior tree can switch among different nodes based on the previous or child node's status.
	&lt;br /&gt;
	This &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://forum.terasology.org/threads/behavior-trees.882/&quot;&gt;forum post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPwBSwq4_mg&quot;&gt;youtube video&lt;/a&gt; would really give you a feel for behavior trees.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These behavior trees are central to the event driven behavior system. Each behavior tree defines a particular type of behavior that can be applied to an entity, for eg-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A “&lt;strong&gt;stray&lt;/strong&gt;” behavior can have a deer idly roam around, walk and stand for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A “&lt;strong&gt;flee&lt;/strong&gt;” behavior can have the deer run away from the player until it’s at a safe (defined minimum) distance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A “&lt;strong&gt;hostile&lt;/strong&gt;” behavior can have the deer close in on the player and then inflict damage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “stray” behavior tree that exists in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Terasology/Pathfinding&quot;&gt;Pathfinding module&lt;/a&gt; module looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/strayBT.png&quot; alt=&quot;stray&quot; title=&quot;stray BT&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these behavior trees can be applied to the entity by simply defining it in the entity’s prefab under the BehaviorComponent. But what’s needed for the animals, is a behavior system that controls what behavior the animal has at any point in time. A system that controls when the behavior needs to switch, what should trigger such a switch and which behavior takes a higher precedence. Enter Event Driven Behavior System.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;collapsiblecontainer&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;collapsibleheader&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;+ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is an event?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;collapsiblecontent&quot;&gt;   
    An event is an action that propagates through all systems in the game to trigger a change or execute some logic. An event is sent to exactly one entity. An event can be received by event handlers, which can add filters for selecting only entities having a certain set of components. Different event handlers can receive the same event in an order of precedence, by specifying a priority.
    &lt;br /&gt;
    This &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki/Events-and-Systems&quot;&gt;wiki page&lt;/a&gt; describes in detail how events work.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WildAnimals module has different packages for different behaviors like “FleeOnHit”, “AttackOnHit”, “AttackInProximity”, “StrayIfIdle”, etc. Each of these packages consists of a system and a component. If such a component is attached to an entity, the respective system takes care of handling the behavior changes associated with that package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;collapsiblecontainer&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;collapsibleheader&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;+ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;How does it work?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;collapsiblecontent&quot;&gt;
    The component from the package whose behavior is to be implemented in an entity, is added to the entity's prefab. Whenever an action/event happens in the game that could trigger a change in the behavior of an entity, an UpdateBehaviorEvent (a consumable event) is sent to the entity. This event is received by event handlers present in any such package's system. These event handlers receive the event based on a priority and trigger the behavior switch by changing the entity's behavior tree inside it's BehaviorComponent.
    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    Let's take the example of the &quot;FleeOnHit&quot; and &quot;StrayIfIdle&quot; package, the first such packages. &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    The FleeOnHit package has a FleeOnHitComponent, which when attached to any wild animal entity would let it exhibit the &quot;flee&quot; behavior when it is hit. &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    The StrayIfIdle package has a StrayIfIdleComponent, which when attached to any wild animal entity would let it exhibit the stray behavior when it is idle and has no other behavior that could get triggered. &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    For the deer, by default it has a behavior of &quot;stray&quot; defined in it's prefab.&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    The FleeOnHitSystem watches for the OnDamageEvent to happen to an entity which has the WildAnimalComponent and FleeOnHitComponent. It saves the event instigator (damage inflictor) to the FleeOnHitComponent and then sends an UpdateBehaviorEvent to the entity to trigger a change if it's needed.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    The UpdateBehaviorEvent is received by the FleeOnHitSystem. It checks for the instigator inside &quot;FleeOnHit&quot; to be non-null, triggers the behavior switch to &quot;flee&quot; and consumes the UpdateBehaviorEvent.&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    The StrayIfIdleSystem also receives the UpdateBehaviorSystem, but with a lower priority.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    When the deer reaches a safe (defined minimum) distance from the player, the instigator in the FleeOnHitComponent is set to null and another UpdateBehaviorEvent is fired from the CheckFleeStopNode (a part of the &quot;flee&quot; Behavior Tree).&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    This event is not consumed by the FleeOnHitSystem event handler as the instigator in FleeOnHitComponent is null. It then is received by the StrayIfIdleSystem event handler, which triggers a behavior switch to &quot;stray&quot; and consumes the event.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    The behavior switches simply happen based on the different priorities the event handlers in the different packages have.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;advantages-of-the-event-driven-behavior-system&quot;&gt;Advantages of the Event Driven Behavior System&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few advantages of using this approach for dealing with complex and multiple behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easily Extendable and Reusable&lt;/strong&gt;: A package consisting of a particular conditional behavior can be used for multiple animals/entities. For eg- the “FleeOnHit” package made for the deer can easily be added to other animals like cows, dogs etc. Adding a behavior is as simple as attaching a component.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efficient&lt;/strong&gt;: There are no constant checks and running loops. The behavior switch is instant.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple Behavior Trees&lt;/strong&gt;: The behavior trees remain bare-bones and minimal, as they have to deal with only one behavior and not worry about switching behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neat Prefabs&lt;/strong&gt;: The prefab for the animal now gives a good picture of what all behaviors it exhibits. A simple deer’s prefab would just have the “FleeOnHit” and “StrayIfIdle” components. A deer’s prefab could look like this:
    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&quot;FleesOnHit&quot;: {
&quot;minDistance&quot;: 15.0
},
&quot;EatsFromBlockIfHungry&quot;: {
 &quot;block&quot;: &quot;grass&quot;,
 &quot;maxWalkDistance&quot;: 4
},
&quot;AttractedByHoldItems&quot;: {
 &quot;items&quot;: [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;nut&quot;]
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clear order of precedence&lt;/strong&gt;: Different behaviors can be given different weights as per priority. A hungry deer when hurt would run for it’s life instead of looking for food. A priority list of behaviors could look like this:
    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; ensure safety (flee if recently damaged)
 ensure not hungry
 ensure not thirsty
 ensure not tired
 ensure not curious (has not watched player / player action / player item recently)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy development&lt;/strong&gt;: With this system, someone who’s making the “EatIfHungry” package does not have to worry about what will happen if the animal is hit when it’s hungry. All he has to do is assign the event handler for the “EatIfHungry” package a lesser priority than the “FleeOnHit” package’s event handler.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post went longer than I had expected it to. The next post would contain details of the deer that have been implemented and maybe new creatures! Most deer at this point are just placeholders for other animals whose models aren’t ready yet. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.terasology.org/members/florian.1335/&quot;&gt;flo&lt;/a&gt; for all his help lately. The whole event driven behavior system idea was born out of a discussion with him. He’s been really helpful in getting my PRs reviewed and merged too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, I was away for 3 days (10th to 12th May) for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acadaccelerator.com/Home/CFDShowCase&quot;&gt;Microsoft code.fun.do SHOWCASE event&lt;/a&gt; that was held in Hyderabad. The trip was fun with sponsored flight trips and hotel stay. Have to catch up with lost time on GSoC though.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Google Summer of Code Selection</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Summer has kicked off with great news. My proposal for the Google Summer of Code with MovingBlocks- Terasology has been selected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-google-summer-of-code&quot;&gt;What is the Google Summer of Code?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/GSoC.png&quot; alt=&quot;GSoC&quot; title=&quot;GSoC&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the uninitiated, Google Summer of Code is a global program targeted at bringing university students into open source. Students work with an open source organization on a 3 month programming project during their summer break. Google first selects around 200 organisations and funds their open source projects. It’s a win-win. The students get an awesome learning experience and a huge stipend. The organisations get a lot of work done from the dedicated students. Well, Google just plays the nice guy being a good Samaritan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be MovingBlocks’ second GSoC selection as a mentoring organisation, which makes it a veteran org already. With a total of 10 slots this year, way more than last year’s 3, this summer might prove to be the immensely productive for MovingBlocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-movingblocks--terasology&quot;&gt;What is MovingBlocks- Terasology?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/gooey.png&quot; alt=&quot;Gooey&quot; title=&quot;Gooey&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology&quot;&gt;Moving Blocks- Terasology&lt;/a&gt; is a minecraft-like open source game built in a voxel world. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel&quot;&gt;voxel&lt;/a&gt; world is essentially a 3-D world made up from blocks. Terasology is still in it’s Alpha stage, but what makes it really special is it’s modularity. With a huge, diverse set of modules already developed/in-development, Terasology offers amazing possibilities. It has a very basic minimal engine, where even core features like health, inventory, combat etc can be added on top or removed as plug-in modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-am-i-doing&quot;&gt;What am I doing?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6685506025816064&quot;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; is titled as &lt;strong&gt;Exploration World- Improved Gameplay&lt;/strong&gt; (proposal &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3HM64I0M4DmYnVWUUpyQkZ2b1k/view&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). In a gist, I plan to add WildAnimals, Puzzles, Exploration and other content to create a new gameplay module. The new gameplay module would pack together the best of whatever is created yet, to create a new gameplay setting that would add meaning and purpose for the end user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My primary mentor would be &lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.terasology.org/members/skysom.1621/&quot;&gt;Skylar ‘skysom’ Sommers&lt;/a&gt; and secondary mentors would be- &lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.terasology.org/members/florian.1335/&quot;&gt;Florian ‘flo’ Köberle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.terasology.org/members/xtariq.1697/&quot;&gt;Xavier ‘xtariq’ Tariq&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.terasology.org/members/isaac.1943/&quot;&gt;Isaac ‘iojw’ Ong&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-am-i-doing-this&quot;&gt;When am I doing this?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my college reopens mid-July, I’ve already started work on the Project. Officially May is meant to be a Community-Bonding period for most and the Coding phase only starts in July. However I plan to finish my GSoC early and I’ve already started off with the coding phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;blog-for-updates&quot;&gt;Blog for updates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to use this blog to keep updating my progress. This blog will also be an attempt to document the work that I’ll be doing. This is gonna be an exciting summer!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>MovingBlocks- GCI Wrap Up</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/GSoC.png&quot; alt=&quot;GSoC&quot; title=&quot;GSoC&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an exciting and productive summer that saw huge commitment, dedication and interest from students and mentors alike in MovingBlock’s first ever Google Summer of Code participation, it was time to gear up for some new beginnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;google-code-in&quot;&gt;Google Code-In&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/GCI.png&quot; alt=&quot;GCI&quot; title=&quot;GCI&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Code-in is a contest that introduces pre-university students (ages 13-17) to open source software development. Students claim tasks from a pre-selected pool of problems from varying genres and difficulty-levels, work on them one at a time, have them approved by the mentors and repeat. At the end, students are awarded with t-shirts, hoodies and a certificate. The top two winners from each organisation get to go on a trip to Google’s Mountain View office in California, along with a mentor. This year, that is the winter of 2016-17, saw &lt;strong&gt;1,340 students from 62 countries&lt;/strong&gt; completing an impressive 6,418 tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MovingBlocks having become a veteran org in GSoC, was eligible to participate in this edition of GCI. By mid November, we had gathered a team of mentors who were actively creating bite-sized tasks ranging in complexity and theme. These tasks were assorted as &lt;strong&gt;Code, Documentation/Training, Outreach/Research, Quality Assurance, User Interface&lt;/strong&gt; etc. &lt;strong&gt;November 28th&lt;/strong&gt; marked the start of student activity that would last till &lt;strong&gt;January 18th&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;winter-has-come&quot;&gt;Winter Has Come&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/winterhascome.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Winter Has Come&quot; title=&quot;Winter Has Come&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the winter winds came gusts of excited students ready to dive into the pool of tasks that we had created. We had for long discussed how the first week (called the “hell week”) is usually the most intense and oh boy, it did get hectic and overwhelming at times. We saw the pile of tasks deplete faster than we could imagine, and students kept sending in work faster than we could review it. At times it became really helpful to have mentors dispersed over the globe so that we spanned all time-zones. At other times, caffeine was our only reliable salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IRC exploded with curious students asking for assistance, Github notifications set new records and we began running out of tasks before we could even wipe the sweat off our foreheads. But the entire mentor team pulled up their socks, converted half-baked ideas into well written task desciptions, added more research, design and documentation related tasks, allowed for existing issued on Github to count as tasks and did lots more. Luckily, Terasology had huge potential for multi-instance tasks in creating equipments, food items, recipes and even new plants inside the game. Some of the best works by students were the splendid World Generators they created. More often than not, most of these tasks were in chains containing sequential tasks, such that each bite-sized task provided an introduction to a topic and had a follow up tasks which ensured a gradual increase in complexity and provided direcion to students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Alpha 6 release event happened midway through GCI and went great with several students checking out our event server, which didn’t even crash once in over 60 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hell-week-is-just-one-week&quot;&gt;Hell Week is just one week?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “hell week” concept which we had just heard about prior to our participation in GCI, became so much more familiar that we realised how it missed an ‘s’ at the end. The hell week had lasted for an entire three weeks with only slight variation in activity, before it took a stark downfall for Christmas. The majority of the “Create Content” tasks had gone into making new items for Cooking, Potions, Equipment, SimpleFarming and we had loads of new things to test out. Task piles were depleting as always and mentors had to stay on their toes to review work that came in like a storm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;crossing-the-finish-line&quot;&gt;Crossing the Finish Line&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/finishflag.png&quot; alt=&quot;Finish Line&quot; title=&quot;Finish Line&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 18th January, the closing whistle for this edition of Google Code-In was blown. At the end we had- &lt;strong&gt;606 tasks completed by 138 students&lt;/strong&gt;, with a total of 222 starting or otherwise getting in touch with us. The &lt;strong&gt;highest&lt;/strong&gt; was from a student who had &lt;strong&gt;42 tasks&lt;/strong&gt; completed. Out of the 17 organisations that had participated, we came out as the &lt;strong&gt;third highest org&lt;/strong&gt; (with respect to number of tasks completed) which was impressive for a first-timer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again with the end of winter, we saw amazing work by so many students around the globe. A huge thank you to all the students who participated, for all their contributions. Keep up the entusiasm and foster the love for open source. Most of all, hats off to all of the 11 other overworked mentors (excluding myself)- &lt;strong&gt;Cervator, Skaldarnar, rzats, oniatus, flo, xtariq, SkySom, manu3d, anthodeus, avalancs, josharias&lt;/strong&gt;. Lastly, thanks to Google for provinding us a platform once again to reach out to students and developers across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whos-the-winner&quot;&gt;Who’s the Winner?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With GCI closing, there was one more task left, but this time for the mentors. But this was no ‘bite-sized’ task. The mentors were required to select the winners, from the top 11 students by quantity of tasks completed (we had a three way tie at the bottom of the top 10 so it became a top 11). This was extremely difficult as all the students in the list had done great and it was just a numbers game for us to select only 5 winners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/GCIwinners.png&quot; alt=&quot;GCI Winners&quot; title=&quot;GCI Winners&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are two articles that have our top 2 winners featured- &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/third-time-lucky-for-student-in-googles-coding-competition&quot;&gt;Isaac Ong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2017/02/04/three-indonesian-students-win-google-open-source-competition.html&quot;&gt;Scott M. Sunarto&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To all the students who didn’t make it to the list, do not get disheartened, you had done amazing work. I’d highly encourage all students who’d be eligible next year to participate once again, as it’ll again be a great learning experience. To those who would not be eligible, try GSoC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real winner, I believe was MovingBlocks, as we witnessed a load of talented students connect with us and deliver amazing work. Some of these have grown to care about the project and our community has grown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;student-reviews&quot;&gt;Student Reviews&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended GCI with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.terasology.org/threads/google-code-in-2016-recap-thread.1752/&quot;&gt;recap thread&lt;/a&gt; to discuss students’ experiences with Terasology. We even went ahead and made it a finishing task which students could claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interests in various parts of the game varied and the we received valuable input on how we could improve on our tasks next year. Overall we received compliments on areas such as interaction, assistance, availability and speedy reviews. General feedback about mentors and our review system was very flattering. Some students described us as the “most accommodating org” and our response rates as “phenonmenal”. One student descibed our tasks as much more fun to do (having advantage of being a game) while another talks about the second family nature of our IRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/terasologylogo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Terasology&quot; title=&quot;Terasology&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a huge learning experience, both for the students and for the Terasology community. We now know a lot many ways in which we can improve the next year. Till then it is time to prepare for GSoC ‘17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/Terasology.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Terasology&quot; title=&quot;Terasology&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a comprehensive guide for getting started with your first contribution to the Terasology project. If you’ve stumbled here and don’t know what Terasology is, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology&quot;&gt;github repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki/Dev-Setup&quot;&gt;Quick Start guide&lt;/a&gt; on the github wiki of the repository is pretty complete, but it can get a little confusing if this is your first time. If not and you want to get cracking as soon as possible, do head over there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without any further ado, let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;run-from-source&quot;&gt;Run from source&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably the first and most important step you need to do before you can do anything else. Also, the first question you’ll be asked on IRC when you’re in doubt, is whether you’re able to “run from source”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-get-java&quot;&gt;1. Get Java&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/java.png&quot; alt=&quot;Java&quot; title=&quot;Java&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java 8 SDK is a requirement for the game to run. You can download this from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; by choosing your OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-get-git&quot;&gt;2. Get Git&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/git.png&quot; alt=&quot;Git&quot; title=&quot;Git&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have git setup, you need to do so before going any further. You’ll need git to collaborate and contribute to this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;collapsiblecontainer&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;collapsibleheader&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;+ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is git?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;collapsiblecontent&quot;&gt;   
	Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
	Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Git allows the users working on a project to mirror and save all changes they make on the central server as well as keep a copy in their own system.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;for-linux&quot;&gt;For Linux:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re on Fedora, you can use yum:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;sudo yum install git-all&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re on a Debian-based distribution like Ubuntu, try apt-get:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;sudo apt-get install git-all&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;for-windows&quot;&gt;For Windows:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download git for windows &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/download/win&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;configuration&quot;&gt;Configuration:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have git installed, open bash (terminal) in Linux or git bash (from Programs) in Windows and get it configured.
git config –global user.name “Your Name”
git config –global user.email “your_email@whatever.com”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-fork&quot;&gt;3. Fork&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/fork.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fork&quot; title=&quot;Fork&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;collapsiblecontainer&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;collapsibleheader&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;+ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is a fork?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;collapsiblecontent&quot;&gt;   
A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Forking the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology&quot;&gt;MovingBlocks/Terasology&lt;/a&gt; repository would create a copy of it at &lt;a&gt;www.github.com/your_github_username/Terasology&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/fork&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to fork the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology&quot;&gt;Terasology github repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Doing so will create a repository named “Terasology” under your github account and take you to it. From now you can access your copy of the repository here: &lt;a&gt;www.github.com/your_github_username/Terasology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-clone&quot;&gt;4. Clone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;collapsiblecontainer&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;collapsibleheader&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;+ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is cloning?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;collapsiblecontent&quot;&gt;   
Cloning downloads or &quot;clones&quot; a repository into a newly created directory by the name of the repository. Cloning www.github.com/your_github_username/Terasology on your machine would create a folder named Teraslogy and download all the content inside it. Use cd to move in and out of directories when inside bash/git-bash.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open up bash (Linux) or git-bash (Windows), go to the directory where you want to clone the repository:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;path/to/directory/
git clone www.github.com/your_github_username/Terasology
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;Terasology/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-run-the-game&quot;&gt;5. Run the game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You now have the repository cloned and can run the game using gradlew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open bash or git-bash, cd in to the Terasology directory and type in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;./gradlew game&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;collapsiblecontainer&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;collapsibleheader&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;+ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is gradlew?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;collapsiblecontent&quot;&gt;   
The gradlew is a script which downloads a version of the Gradle through which most of the automation happens. The initial gradlew execution will download all project dependencies and could take a while. So, be patient.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should show a build log, and launch the game. If this worked you’re able to run from source. If it didn’t you should get back to IRC and ask for help in debugging. However, any problem encountered at this point is usually from Java not being configured right, such as having an older version as your default Java. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki/Common-Issues&quot;&gt;Common Issues&lt;/a&gt; for more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask in the Support Forum if issues remain, or come join us on #terasology on Freenode IRC. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki/Using-IRC&quot;&gt;Using IRC&lt;/a&gt; and please be patient! IRC isn’t necessarily instant communication and it may take a while to get a reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-use-an-ide&quot;&gt;6. Use an IDE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this large a project, you could easily get lost and ‘grep’ing would be inefficient. We have a series of customizations that prepare run configurations, Git integration, and so on for the project, specifically for IntelliJ. Eclipse has fewer of these but is still entirely usable, as is NetBeans, but you’ll need to figure out some details there yourself. I personally recommend the use of Intelij IDEA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/intellij.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Intellij&quot; title=&quot;Intellij&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;install-intellij-idea-on-linux&quot;&gt;Install Intellij IDEA on Linux:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;sudo apt-add-repository ppa:mmk2410/intellij-idea-community
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install intellij-idea-community&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;install-intellij-idea-on-windows&quot;&gt;Install Intellij IDEA on Windows:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download and install the setup from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open bash or git-bash and type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;./gradlew idea&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would prepare project files for Intellij. Open the resulting Terasology.ipr as an existing project in IntelliJ - do not create a new project or attempt to import the project via Gradle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-find-a-bug&quot;&gt;7. Find a Bug&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you are able to run from source and preferably have an IDE set up, you should get started with working on your first bug. The complete list of issues can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/issues&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. However, you should look for issus with the tag &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Bite-size&lt;/code&gt;. All bite-sized issues can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ABite-size&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;8-code-code-and-code&quot;&gt;8. Code, code and code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default you would be on the develop branch. Before you start making changes to the code, remember to create a new branch. This can be skipped, however it is the best practice, especially when working on multiple issues. Also, if you don’t create a new branch, a Pull Request for your second bug fix will also contain a fix for the first bug, if the first PR isn’t merged till then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;collapsiblecontainer&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;collapsibleheader&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;+ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is a branch?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;collapsiblecontent&quot;&gt;   
Within a repository you have branches, which are effectively forks within your own repository. Your branches will have an ancestor commit in your repository, and will diverge from that commit with your changes. You can later merge your branch changes. Branches let you work on multiple disparate features at once.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creating-a-new-branch&quot;&gt;Creating a new branch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open bash or git-bash and type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;git checkout -b new_branch_name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get cracking on a solution. Ask on IRC when in doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;9-make-your-first-contribution&quot;&gt;9. Make your first contribution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve come up with a fix, it’s time to commit those changes and create a pull request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;commit-your-changes&quot;&gt;Commit your changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open bash or git-bash and type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;git add -A
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# to add all files to staging. You could select individual files too&lt;/span&gt;
git commit -m &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Fix for #1234&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# to commit changes with a relevant commit message.&lt;/span&gt;
git push origin new_branch_name
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Push to the newly created branch on your fork&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;collapsiblecontainer&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;collapsibleheader&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;+ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is a commit?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;collapsiblecontent&quot;&gt;   
Whenever you commit in git, you take a screenshot of your working directory or your repository. You could come back to this state of your repository later at any point or publish these changes to your fork of the repository.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;collapsiblecontainer&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;collapsibleheader&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;+ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is pushing?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;collapsiblecontent&quot;&gt;   
In git, when you push, you bring the changes on your local repository come into effect in the remote repository. In this case changes to the branch &quot;new_branch_name&quot; are published on the remote (&quot;origin&quot;) repository www.github.com/your_github_username/Terasology.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve pushed successfully, open up your fork (www.github.com/your_github_username/Terasology). This should show something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/terasologyPR.png&quot; alt=&quot;PR&quot; title=&quot;PR&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clicking on “Compare &amp;amp; pull request” opens a page for you to describe your bug and solution. The pull request compares (head) your_github_username/Terasology/new_branch_name with (base) MovingBlocks/Terasology/develop. Fill in everything and hit “Create Pull Request”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once done, let the mentors have a look at your PR. If they want changes, you should make the required changes, test locally and then, create a new commit in the same branch and finally push.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;10-goto-7&quot;&gt;10. Goto 7&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t stop now. Go find another bug to fix! :D&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mozilla: Quarter of Contribution</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have decided to dive into open source development this summer. Under the WnCC Seasons of Code programme, I have chosen to take part in the Mozilla Quarter of Contribution project mentored by Kalpesh Krishna (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/martiansideofthemoon&quot;&gt;martiansideofthemoon&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href=&quot;http://wncc-iitb.org/soc/&quot;&gt;WnCC Seasons of Code&lt;/a&gt; is an initiative by the Web and Coding Club of IIT Bombay, much akin to the Google Summer Of Code but without any monetary incentive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mozilla-quarter-of-contribution&quot;&gt;Mozilla: Quarter of Contribution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/New_Contributor/Quarter_of_Contribution&quot;&gt;Mozilla: Quarter of Contribution&lt;/a&gt; is an opportunity to work on a large project for a couple of months. Current projects for Summer 2016 are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Web Platform Tests - Results Viewer Refactoring (:jgraham, :martianwars)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Perfherder (:wlach, :jmaher)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talos (:jmaher, :rwood)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have made a few bug fixes and have merged PRs on Web Platform Tests as well as Perfherder. I have decided to work on wptview under &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jgraham&quot;&gt;:jgraham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/martianwars/&quot;&gt;:martianwars&lt;/a&gt; as a part of Mozilla QoC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wptview&quot;&gt;wptview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla/wptview&quot;&gt;Wptview&lt;/a&gt; is a web platform test viewer. The Web Platform Tests (WPT) are a set of cross browser validation tests designed to validate common functionality on the web between browsers. Wptview is used for viewing the results of web-platform-tests and for easy visual comparison between different tests results. One can add the test data available as mozlog files and all the tests along with their results will be loaded in the form of a table. These results can be studied further by adding filters and sorting by status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/New_Contributor/Quarter_of_Contribution/WPTViewer_Refactor&quot;&gt;agenda for the QoC&lt;/a&gt; is a UI revamp, addition of unit testing as well as adding visualizations to be accompanied by test results. I would like to work on all these fratures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have fixed a few basic bugs due to which I know a little about the codebase. I am a beginner in AngularJS and plan to learn as I go on contributing to this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I plan to learn a lot contributing to this project. This is my first hand at open source as well, so I hope it turns out to be an exciting learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Auto Deploy on Server</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It had been a while since I had been using a server to host the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wncc-iitb.org&quot;&gt;website for WnCC&lt;/a&gt;. With a lot of development happening around, updating and testing changes on the server, had become a requirement. Having built the site in Jekyll, I required to shift the contents of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_site&lt;/code&gt; from my local machine to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/var/www/html&lt;/code&gt; on the server, after every build. I had been following the simple, standard method of using scp, for a long time. Copying all the content from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_site&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/var/www/html&lt;/code&gt; was now becoming inefficient (as I copied all the files in the folder all over again), took a lot of time as the site started expanding with more multimedia content, and required a long terminal command too. I could have used a probably more efficient way of SSHing into the server, pulling from the git repository and copying the contents of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_site&lt;/code&gt; folder into &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/var/www/html&lt;/code&gt;. But this would have been tedious too, and probably could have been made easier with a script. Nevertheless, it would have required me to SSH into the server, and atleast a couple of terminal commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;discovering-github-webhooks&quot;&gt;Discovering &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.github.com/webhooks/&quot;&gt;Github Webhooks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter webhooks. &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.github.com/webhooks/&quot;&gt;Webhooks&lt;/a&gt; allow one to set up an integration with their github repository to listen for one or more events. Whenever such an event occurs, Github sends a HTTP POST payload to the webhook’s configured URL. An event can occur with the creation of an issue, a push to the server or be triggered whenever a repository is starred, forked etc. Webhooks can be used to do a lot of things. I have used a webhook, in this example for the quite general purpose of setting up an auto-deplow on my server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Github provides a quite &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.github.com/webhooks/configuring/&quot;&gt;comprehensive guide&lt;/a&gt; about how to set up a webhook to the local host which is connected to the web using &lt;a href=&quot;https://ngrok.com/download&quot;&gt;ngrok&lt;/a&gt;. I followed the guide and replicated similar steps on my server to get my webhook configured to send a HTTP POST payload to the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-sinatra&quot;&gt;Using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sinatrarb.com/&quot;&gt;Sinatra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used Sintara to create a simple web framework which would receive a HTTP POST made to the configured server URL, and run a small shell command. Having written this small piece of code, I could now reflect all changes made in the repository on the website, everytime a push is made to the repository. The following code renames the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; folder inside &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/var/www/&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_site&lt;/code&gt; and performs a git pull inside &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/var/www&lt;/code&gt; and later renames it back to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;html&lt;/code&gt;. This is done as the built site lies inside the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_site&lt;/code&gt; folder of the repository. I&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# hook.rb&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'sinatra'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'json'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'0.0.0.0'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'/payload'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#push = JSON.parse(request.body.read)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#puts &quot;I got some JSON: #{push.inspect}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;output&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`mv html _site ; git pull origin master; mv _site html`&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ruby hook.rb -o 0.0.0.0&lt;/code&gt; will give a message like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Sinatra/1.4.4 has taken the stage on 4567...&lt;/code&gt;. Making a POST request on http://IP:4567/payload, will now trigger the shell command in the above script. (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-o 0.0.0.0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;set :bind, '0.0.0.0'&lt;/code&gt; allows access from networks other than localhost)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; You may have to enable the port if you are using a firewall on your server. A simple &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo ufw allow 4567&lt;/code&gt; should do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However this session of Sinatra will close as soon as you CTRL+C out of it or logout. To keep such an instance running even after logout you could try&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nohup sudo ruby hook.rb -o 0.0.0.0 &amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would put the Sinatra process in background and keep it running even after you have logged out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not know about github webhooks earlier and this was an interesting find. The above was a quick setup for automation. If you know a way in which I could improve it, do let me know in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Till next time!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>J.A.R.V.I.S.</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;center w100&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/jarvis.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;J.A.R.V.I.S.&quot; title=&quot;J.A.R.V.I.S.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost a week ago, I attempted to create &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nihal111/J.A.R.V.I.S&quot;&gt;my own version&lt;/a&gt; of Iron Man’s J.A.R.V.I.S. which would perform a few tasks and have chatbot like abilities. After a bit of research I found out about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alicebot.org/aiml.html&quot;&gt;AIML&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyAIML&quot;&gt;interpreter for python&lt;/a&gt;. I also found ways to convert text to speech and speech to to text using python libraries like &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyttsx&quot;&gt;pyttsx&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SpeechRecognition/3.4.3&quot;&gt;SpeechRecognition&lt;/a&gt;. I soon ended up making a J.A.R.V.I.S. which understood some of the things I said and performed a few fun actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;configuring-voice-input-and-output&quot;&gt;Configuring voice input and output:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;text-to-speech&quot;&gt;Text to Speech:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With pyttsx installed through &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pip install pyttsx&lt;/code&gt; or otherwise,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;pyttsx&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;speak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;jarvis_speech&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;engine&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pyttsx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;engine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;say&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;jarvis_speech&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;engine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;runAndWait&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;speak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello world&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should produce an audio output of “Hello World” in a slightly mechanical voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;speech-to-text&quot;&gt;Speech-to-Text:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With SpeechRecognition installed through &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pip install SpeechRecognition&lt;/code&gt; or otherwise,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;speech_recognition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;sr&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Recognizer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Microphone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
	    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Talk to J.A.R.V.I.S: &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;audio&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
	    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;recognize_google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;audio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;recognize_google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;audio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UnknownValueError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
	    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;offline_speak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;I couldn't understand what you said! Would you like to repeat?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;RequestError&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
	    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Could not request results from Google Speech Recognition service; {0}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should listen to an audio input once from the microphone. However this can produce a series of warnings and errors. Resolution for some errors can be found in the Troubleshooting section of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SpeechRecognition/3.4.3&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;working-with-aiml&quot;&gt;Working with AIML:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AIML stands for Artificial Intelligence Markup Language. AIML is XML based markup language meant to create artificial intelligent application to create human interface. Using AIML, the implementation remains easy to program and highly maintainable. However, the development for AIML has become rather stagnant and AIML 1.0 (the one which has a python interpreter) has a documentation dating back to 2005, making it quite obsolete. Nevertheless, AIML is easy to learn and fun to use. At the very basic level, AIML recognizes patterns and gives responses as programmed. The patterns are called categories and responses are called templates. A very basic AIML code looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-xml&quot; data-lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;aiml&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;version=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;1.0.1&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;encoding=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;UTF-8&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;category&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;pattern&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;HELLO&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/pattern&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;template&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		Well, hello!
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/template&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/category&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/aiml&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This small piece of code allows J.A.R.V.I.S. to reply with “Well, hello!” for every “HELLO” it gets as input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a code can then be customised to give a random output from a list of templates, redirect to a already defined pattern, use a part or whole of the user’s input, run shell scripts etc. Out of all these running a shell script makes AIML, or atleast J.A.R.V.I.S. very powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All one has to do to create a chatbot using AIML, is to make up a list of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.aiml&lt;/code&gt; files containing categories like the one defined above and use the aiml library for python to import them into a kernel using a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;startup.xml&lt;/code&gt; file which looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-xml&quot; data-lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;aiml&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;version=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;1.0.1&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;encoding=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;UTF-8&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;category&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;pattern&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;LOAD AIML&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/pattern&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;template&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;          
            &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;learn&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;*.aiml&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/learn&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/template&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;        
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/category&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/aiml&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should allow one to load up all the aiml files present in the working directory to the created kernel. A simple python script to do is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;aiml&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;kernel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;aiml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Kernel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;kernel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;learn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;startup.xml&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;kernel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;respond&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;load aiml&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;kernel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;respond&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;raw_input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Talk to J.A.R.V.I.S: &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good guide to get started with AIML using the python interpreter can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devdungeon.com/content/ai-chat-bot-python-aiml&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-the-system-tag&quot;&gt;Using the &amp;lt;system&amp;gt; tag:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system tag in AIML is a very powerful tag. It allows the script to run a shell command and use its output. A very simple example of this is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-xml&quot; data-lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;category&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;pattern&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;WHAT TIME IS IT&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/pattern&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;template&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        The time is &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;system&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;date &quot;+%l:%M %P&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/system&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/template&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/category&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;date &quot;+%l:%M %P&quot;&lt;/code&gt; in shell returns the current time in a 12 hour format like “6:12 PM”. This can be used as a template output for the question “What time is it?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the &amp;lt;system&amp;gt; tag one can achieve a lot of functionalities like opening applications, killing running processes, changing volume levels, adjusting brightness, changing wallpapers etc. And J.A.R.V.I.S. does quite a few of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;integrating-python-scripts&quot;&gt;Integrating Python scripts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it is easy enough to use shell commands through AIML. It is equally easy to use the shell to run python scripts and perform tasks using their output. A really fun example and perhaps the best feature of J.A.R.V.I.S. is the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;finding-and-playing-a-song-on-youtube&quot;&gt;Finding and playing a song on youtube&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the following python script, to find the link for first result for a given &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;query&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;urllib&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;urllib2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;bs4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BeautifulSoup&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;flag&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;argv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;strip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;+&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;urllib2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;urlopen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;soup&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BeautifulSoup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;lxml&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;soup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;findAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;attrs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'class'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'yt-uix-tile-link'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'https://www.youtube.com'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'href'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;startswith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;flag&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'https://www.youtube.com'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'href'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;flag&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://www.youtube.com&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and this AIML file which opens the link provided by the above script in chromium-browser:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-xml&quot; data-lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;category&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;pattern&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;PLAY SONG *&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/pattern&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;template&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;random&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Sure thing! &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Right away, sir! &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;On it! &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/random&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;system&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; chromium-browser &quot;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;system&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; python youtube.py &quot;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;star/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/system&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/system&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/template&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/category&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the following output can be achieved:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk to J.A.R.V.I.S :&lt;/strong&gt; play song Killswitch Engage This Fire Burns&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;J.A.R.V.I.S:&lt;/strong&gt; Sure thing!  Created new window in existing browser session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPpJ7xyUapc&quot;&gt;song&lt;/a&gt; opened in a new chromium-browser tab.&lt;br /&gt;
I have improved the above AIML code to produce this output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk to J.A.R.V.I.S :&lt;/strong&gt; play me a song&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;J.A.R.V.I.S :&lt;/strong&gt; What song, sir?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Talk to J.A.R.V.I.S :&lt;/strong&gt; Killswitch Engage This Fire Burns&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;J.A.R.V.I.S :&lt;/strong&gt; On it!  Created new window in existing browser session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The repository for J.A.R.V.I.S. lies &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nihal111/J.A.R.V.I.S&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

        <title>Playing with aliases</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I can’t do without my games, I can’t do without Windows, and I have to dualboot. This means that most of my data is stored on a disk shared between both the operating systems. The path to the directory where I keep my projects thus becomes rather long. And I like to keep an alias for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;alias &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'cd /media/Nihal/Code'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this would do is create an alias by the name of ‘code’ which would exist till the time you killed the terminal. Rather I have created a permanent alias for it, which is stored by copying the above line into the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.bash_aliases&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; file in the home directory (if it doesn’t exist, you should really create one). I wanted to create a few more permanent aliases as and when needed and the process to do so felt tedious. Alas! I wrote another alias for it. Let’s talk about the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.bash_aliases&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; file before getting there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-bashrc-file&quot;&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; file&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the home directory there also exists a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; file which shall contain a lot of oher things. The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; file is a script which executes evereytime a terminal is started in the &lt;strong&gt;interactive mode&lt;/strong&gt;. It contains a set of configurations for the terminal.  The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; file provides a space to set up variables, functions, aliases etc that you may want to use. The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; is then run every time you open up a new terminal. Be careful, that any error or change you make in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; file will be reflected in all subsequent terminal windows launced. Also if you have a terminal window running, and you make changes to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; file thereafter, you will obviously have no effect on the running terminal and you may want to restart it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;loading-the-bash_aliases-file&quot;&gt;Loading the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.bash_aliases&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; file&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; file does a fine job of loading the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.bash_aliases&lt;/code&gt; file like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; -f ~/.bash_aliases &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
    . ~/.bash_aliases
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This essentially allows &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; to load the ‘.bash_aliases’ file within itself, preventing you from meddling with it and managing the list of aliases neatly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creating-a-permanent-alias&quot;&gt;Creating a Permanent Alias&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a permanent alias is easy. Just open up ~/.bash_aliases and append the following line to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;alias &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'bar'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you type in “foo”, “bar” will be passed as an input to the terminal.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; You can do this with ~/.bashrc as well but it is neater not to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A perhaps better way to do this would be to automate the task and save yourself the hassle of opening a the fine and appending to it manually. And what better way to create aliases by using another alias? I wanted to have a way to create a permanent alias by just typing in a ‘p’ before alias like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;palias &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'bar'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, I opened up &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.bash_aliases&lt;/code&gt; and created a function called permanent_alias and called it every time I entered “palias” on the terminal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;permanent_alias&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$1&lt;/span&gt; | cut -d&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;=&quot;&lt;/span&gt; -f 1&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;VALUE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$1&lt;/span&gt; | cut -d&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;=&quot;&lt;/span&gt; -f 2-&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; -e &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;alias &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;='&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$VALUE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;'&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /home/nihal/.bash_aliases
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;New permanent bash alias set: alias &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;='&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$VALUE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;'&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; -f ~/.bash_aliases &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
	    . ~/.bash_aliases
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#Create alias for function call&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;alias &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;palias&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'permanent_alias'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;explanation&quot;&gt;Explanation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$1 is a &lt;strong&gt;positional parameter&lt;/strong&gt; that returns the first argument passed. Since “palias” is an alias to a function call, it returns the first word after the word “palias”, without the inverted commas. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;palias foo='bar'&lt;/code&gt; will return foo=bar as $1.&lt;br /&gt;
Interestingly, $0 returns the address of the script or shell running. In this case /bin/bash&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$KEY&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;$VALUE&lt;/strong&gt; variables are defined by splitting the string in $1 at the first “=”. The string &lt;strong&gt;$1&lt;/strong&gt; is passed to cut and with delimiter (&lt;strong&gt;-d&lt;/strong&gt;) as “&lt;strong&gt;=&lt;/strong&gt;”, fields (&lt;strong&gt;-f&lt;/strong&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;2-&lt;/strong&gt; are selected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;foo='bar'&quot;&lt;/span&gt; | cut -d&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;=&quot;&lt;/span&gt; -f 1
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#returns &quot;foo&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;foo='bar'&quot;&lt;/span&gt; | cut -d&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;=&quot;&lt;/span&gt; -f 2
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#returns &quot;bar&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;echo &quot;foo='bar'&quot; | cut -d&quot;=&quot; -f 1&lt;/code&gt; has the same effect as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;echo &quot;foo='bar'&quot; | cut --delimiter=&quot;=&quot; --fields 1 &lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;echo &quot;foo='bar==car'&quot; | cut -d&quot;=&quot; -f 2-&lt;/code&gt; fetches ‘bar==car’ while &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;echo &quot;foo='bar==car'&quot; | cut -d&quot;=&quot; -f 2&lt;/code&gt; fetches ‘bar&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once KEY and VALUE are abstracted, they are appended to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.bash_aliases&lt;/code&gt; file using&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; -e &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;alias &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;='&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$VALUE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;'&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /home/user/.bash_aliases&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;  The -e flag is for enabling interpretation of backslash escapes like “\n” (newline). &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;echo &quot;string&quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; file&lt;/code&gt; is used to append “string” at the end of file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then . ~/.bash_aliases fi&lt;/code&gt; allows you to use your newly declared permanent alias in the running terminal too, by loading the bash_aliases file again. Not doing this, would result in restarting of terminal for changes to take effect. (Thanks Vinayak for pointing out)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;usage&quot;&gt;Usage&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For single word aliases, scrapping the inverted commas would do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;palias &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'bar'&lt;/span&gt;
and
palias &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;bar
would have same effect as we manually add inverted commas later.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;	However,
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;palias &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'cd /home'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#$1 = &quot;foo=cd /home&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
and
palias &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; /home	
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#$1 = &quot;foo=cd&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
would not have the same effect.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For special characters like “ ( , ) , @” etc, scrapping the inverted commas would not work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;palias &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'permanent_alias()'&lt;/span&gt;
and
palias &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;permanent_alias&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
would not have same effect as &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;(&quot;&lt;/span&gt; would be an unexpected token.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Garbage after the first space won’t matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;palias &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'bar'&lt;/span&gt;
and
palias &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'bar'&lt;/span&gt; this is an amazing blog
would have same effect.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spaces around the “=” in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;palias foo = 'bar'&lt;/code&gt; wouldn’t work. They wouldn’t work with regular alias either, for that matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re still reading, I hope you found it useful. Till next time! :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blog init</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, there! You’ve stumbled upon my first blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while since I first thought of creating my github homepage and blog. And I can’t believe I finally made it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, this is the first time I’ve used &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; to create a website. Apart from a few impediments in CSS, the journey to completion was smooth. The markdown to HTML conversion is awesome and blog maintenance is easy as well. You could &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nihal111/nihal111.github.io/fork&quot;&gt;fork&lt;/a&gt; this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nihal111/nihal111.github.io&quot;&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt; and play around with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve made a &lt;a href=&quot;/projects&quot;&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt; section which I’ll keep updating with my latest developments and contributions. I plan to use this blog to write about my experiences and other interesting stuff I come across.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a long night. I should go to bed before sunrise!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;blog init
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello World!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
